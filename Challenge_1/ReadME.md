## Overview of Project
## This project analyzes the data gathered of a some campaigns in several countries comparing them with theirs goals, pledges, outcomes and launching dates among other characteristics so we can have helpful insights and take better and quick decisions.

### Purpose
### This analysis will help Louise understand how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals now that her is coming close to its fundraising goal. This analysis will be focused in the campaigns by launch date, goal and outcomes.

## Analysis and Challenges
## On this analysis I took two approaches, the first one analyzes the campaigns based on their launch dates and see which ones were more successful depending on their launch month and the second analysis is focused on how success a campaign were depending on their goal range. The challenge here was to define the goal ranges for the analysis and validate if the granularity tells us a good story and then to split all the campaigns by dates due to itâ€™s particular way to express this fields on the data set (Unix type).

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

* What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

* What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

* What are some limitations of this dataset?

* What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
